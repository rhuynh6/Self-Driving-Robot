# Self Driving Robot
**Team Number**: Team AOHW25_805

## Project Description
This project is a robot that is able to autonomously navigate a turn with a lane navigation algorithm and a PID controller. It is implemented in two ways: one where the lane navigation algorithm is run in software and one where it runs in hardware. We chose to single out the lane navigation algorithm as it took up most of the system's execution time. By implmementing it in software and hardware, we aim to examine the difference in overall performance between the two methods.

## Directory Description
- 'benchmark': Contains test files made during the development of the project.
- 'main': Contains final code including the hardware and software implementations of the lane navigation algorithms.
